# Dungeon Crawler

A blazing fast RPG (from the book "Hands-on Rust").

## Description

Keeping with the theme of a Dungeon Crawler, the game sees the adventurer arrive in a randomly generated dungeon. The player guides their adventurer around the dungeon, defeating monsters and collecting power-ups until they find the Amulet of Yala (“Yet Another Lost Amulet”) and win the game.
